# Learning Development

We have three main areas of learning development at Grace Cafe.

1. GED. This is mainly through the General Education Diploma (GED) programme.&#x20;
2. Internship. This is a self-directed learning journey focused on acquiring knowledge and skills in career pathways of one's choice.&#x20;
3. Learning environment developer. This is a learning journey in how to help yourself and others maximise the inherent potential we have through effective and efficient learning philosophies (link to learning philosophy).

All three areas are deeply rooted in a Jesus focused learning environment intent on fulfilling our mission (link to mission).

A social call will be scheduled for the whole team to meet and introduce themselves.

### GED onboarding

Students who join with the intent of obtaining their GED go through the following onboarding process. All the content is hosted on our website and each student will be given individual access to the content. A quiz will exist at the end of each learning module to ensure that the student understands.

A typical onboarding and learning journey for GED students follows. While this is suggested, it is not meant to be prescriptive:

1. Personal values exercise
2. Understanding the values of Grace Cafe. Using case studies quiz to check for understanding.
3. Handbook high level training and quiz. Not checking for understanding of content, only of location and navigation.
4. Unpacking the GED journey. Mostly testing for navigation skills, not for content understanding.
5. Explaining GED content.&#x20;
6. Choosing learning path timeline.
7. Choosing the final exam, paid practice exam and free practice exam dates. These can easily be moved in the plan with time.

11. Klavaro typing tutor. You will download and install this and enter your scores weekly. The faster and more accurate you can type, the better it will be in the exam.

14. University/Work exploration: you will do an assessment as an indicator of possible career fit options.
15. University/Work requirements. We help you reverse engineer what the requirements will be to study or work in your area of choice. These are never guaranteed to pan out the way you want it so treat this exercise as an art and exploration of possibilities, rather than a science and set in stone.
