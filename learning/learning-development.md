# Learning Development

We have three main areas of learning development at Grace Cafe.

1. Online High-school. This is mainly through the General Education Diploma \(GED\) programme. 
2. Internship. This is a self-directed learning journey focused on acquiring knowledge and skills in career pathways of one's choice. 
3. Learning environment developer. This is a learning journey in how to help yourself and others maximise the inherent potential we have through effective and efficient learning philosophies \(link to learning philosophy\).

All three areas are deeply rooted in a Jesus focused learning environment intent on fulfilling our mission \(link to mission\).

### General onboarding

IT will send you an invite for Slack and Trello.

Install Slack on computer. Use your @Grace Cafe to create your account.

Install Trello on computer. Use your @Grace Cafe to create your account.

Google Meet is our default video conferencing software

Introduce yourself in the \#introductions Slack channel.

Have your onboarding buddy help you create a learning journey card for you in Trello through a Google Meet call.

A social call will be scheduled for the whole team to meet and introduce themselves.

### GED onboarding

Students who join with the intent of obtaining their GED go through the following onboarding process. All the content is hosted on our website and each student will be given individual access to the content. A quiz will exist at the end of each learning module to ensure that the student understands.

A typical onboarding and learning journey for GED students follows. While this is suggested, it is not meant to be prescriptive:

1. Personal values exercise
2. Understanding the values of Grace Cafe. Using case studies quiz to check for understanding.
3. Handbook high level training and quiz. Not checking for understanding of content, only of location and navigation.
4. Unpacking the GED journey. Mostly testing for navigation skills, not for content understanding.
5. Explaining GED content. 
6. Choosing learning path timeline.
7. Choosing the final exam, paid practice exam and free practice exam dates. These can easily be moved in the plan with time.
8. Choosing your subject order.
9. Certain activities have been specifically designed so as to help with your GED exams. These are all optional. As you improve your performance in the GED specific content, more content and facilitated sessions will be made available to you.
10. Content: GED content via Khan Academy. You will be added as a student in the Grace Cafe class on Khan Academy. You will be quizzed on your ability to navigate the Khan Academy website. A buddy will help you with this too.
11. Klavaro typing tutor. You will download and install this and enter your scores weekly. The faster and more accurate you can type, the better it will be in the exam.
12. Coursera course. Learning how to Learn for youth \(link here\) is one of the top 10 online courses of all time. It teaches students about effective learning techniques. On completion of the course quizzes will check on students implementation of these techniques.
13. GED mailing lists, support groups. There is a whatsapp group, telegram group, facebook groups, and email mailing list, all with their unique function in supporting you in this learning journey.
14. University/Work exploration: you will do an assessment as an indicator of possible career fit options.
15. University/Work requirements. We help you reverse engineer what the requirements will be to study or work in your area of choice. These are never guaranteed to pan out the way you want it so treat this exercise as an art and exploration of possibilities, rather than a science and set in stone.

### Internship onboarding

Students who have matriculated or who have completed their GED studies qualify for the internship learning journey at Grace Cafe. This is a mostly self-directed learning journey. Interns have an annual contract where an evaluation is done in terms of their benefit from and to the learning hub and whether the contract will be renewed for another year or not.
