# Incident Management for Self-Managed Students

### Using circle meetings for issues

Please use the below process should you have a conflict or issue at Grace Cafe. 

1. Seek to resolve the conflict/issue as soon as is reasonably possible. Dealing with the problem yourself is usually recommended. Unless the issue involves someone's immediate safety. In that case you should call for help immediately and any appropriate authorities.
2. If the conflict/issue is not resolvable immediately or by yourself, then report the issue through a circle meeting. Again, if urgent then raise with a manager immediately.
3. In a circle meeting, once the issue is raised, the facilitator will guide the process. The issue will be captured, and opportunities for proposal creation will then be possible. 
4. If you are not happy with the process of plan for addressing the issue then it should be mentioned in the circle too. 
5. If the process or plan cannot be agreed upon in the circle meeting then you need to report it to your manager as soon as is reasonably possible in the circumstance.
6. If the plan or process identified by the manager is not satisfactory for you either then you need to raise it with the general circle and then the mission circle if still not sorted.
7. **Again, if it is a matter of safety \(emotional, physical etc\) then the appropriate authorities need to be notified by you, the originator of the conflict/issue.**
