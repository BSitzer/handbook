# Learning Philosophies

Grace Cafe is influenced by various schools of thought. To get a sense of some of the influences watch the below videos:

### Self-Directed Education

We hold the belief that children inherently want to learn but that destructive learning experiences as children cause children to associate learning and engagement as two different things. Our aim therefore is to tread the difficult path of helping students fall in love with learning again. This is a healing journey of trust and exploration between the students and the facilitators. Outside of the GED, there is no set curriculum to make this happen. This is always a personal experience by the students helped along through content, processes and most importantly, relationships with caring peers and adults. We therefore hold the philosophy of self-directed education as a goal to be achieved. This does not mean we are disconnected from the students and allow them to do anything. Within the governance of Sociocracy, we coexist in community with others. We also live into the values of Grace Cafe and our personal values.  

### Self-Managed Education

Distinct from self-directed education is the drive to help student manage their own learning journey's. This might be a self-directed learning journey or one that has been largely given to them. Either way, strong skills are needed to manage the progression of the learning journey. We spend time with students and team members developing the knowledge of what these character traits are and developing the required skills.

### Learning principles 

These are core principles we believe world class students exhibit. The goal is for students to develop intrinsic motivators that fosters and honours these principles, in a way that works for Grace Cafe and the student.

1. **Hiring is Job One**. "A" players attract "A" players. Given the strategic importance of selecting the right student and staff, a strong team creates enormous leverage. We should strive to raise the average competency for the team with each new hire. We DO NOT select on academic skills or economic strength. These are secondary factors. We select students and staff with the right characteristics and priorities for joining our team and with whom we can work with to continue and accelerate their learning trajectory while living into their personal and Grace Cafe values. See our hiring guide for more info.
2. **Care personally & challenge directly**. Team members that feel safe plus managers that coach honestly is how people do their best work. We encourage timely and actionable feedback, as well as managers that take the time to get to know their people as humans with feelings and personal lives, not just resources.
   1. Helpful resource: Radical Candor
3. **Always be learning**. Continuously seek ways to fundraise and invest in skills development, and have a growth mindset as individuals and as a team.
   1. Helpful resource: Peak
4. **As a manager, you’re not the student**. As staff, talk to the students. It is tempting to assume that we understand our students, but we are often wrong. We validate our assumptions through qualitative and quantitative student input.
   1. Helpful resources: Inspired. Competing Against Luck. Get in the Van.
5. **Start with the problem, not the solution**. It is tempting to dive right into solutioning, but we are often wrong about the underlying problem. A well formed problem statement is the key to a successful learning project.
   1. Helpful resources: Love the Problem Not Your Solution. Great PM’s Don’t Spend Their Time on Solutions.
6. **Prioritise relentlessly**. It is better to do a few things well than many things poorly. We should focus first on what we’re best at and what we need to learn most, with a preference for simplicity. Exams and testing will tell us when we’re missing something we need, but they’re unlikely to tell us how to learn what we need to.
   1. Helpful resources: RICE.
7. **Assume you are wrong**. Human intuition is often wrong. To fight this, have a hypothesis and try to invalidate it quickly.
   1. Helpful resource: Thinking, Fast & Slow
8. **Iterate**. Leverage a fast-paced build-measure-learn feedback loop to iterate your way to a good solution, rather than trying to plan it all out up front.
9. **Be data driven**. Always have success metrics, track them, and try to move them in the right direction with our actions.
   1. Helpful resource: How to Measure Anything
10. **Use Pomodoro’s**. From the Learning How to Learn for Youth course you will learn about Pomodoro’s. Use them.
11. **Be curiosity driven**. Let your curiosity drive you to learning paths and exploring different content. The fuel of curiosity will keep you going for hours and years.
12. **Focus on recall**. Whether using active recall, flash cards, mind palaces or any other technique, focus on recall through the process of spaced repetition. Again, a technique taught thoroughly in the learning how to learn for youth course.

### How we follow our Principles

**Peer mentoring**: We believe that forming a learning community depends on the students helping each other. Therefore staff are to regularly encourage and mobilise students to help each other in their learning journeys. They are to create these opportunities with mutual consent and expectation that this is part of living out two of Grace Cafe’s core values, love and collaboration.

**Planfulness**: If we fail to plan then we plan to fail. Each Monday morning everyone spends time planning their week. Each weekday \(Mon - Friday\), everyone spends time planning each day. Every weekday \(Mon - Friday\) everyone spends time reviewing what they planned to do for the day versus what they actually did. Each Friday everyone spends time reviewing what they planned to do for the week versus what they actually did. This is done via journalling and via a Trello review.



Everyone also spends time populating a calendar of the main activities they will spend doing and the time of day they will spend doing it. This could be in a physical calendar or Google Calendar.

Planning key activities in one's calendar and reviewing it regularly are key actions to be done daily to notice one's planned behaviour. This is meant to be a balance of intentionality but also given yourself grace and permission to deviate from the plan. An attitude of self-loathing is strongly discouraged when things don’t go according to plan. Rather, an attitude of pleasant curiosity and investigation is encouraged without condemnation. 



Planfulness should be both a personal journey as well as a group sharing opportunity to learn about the joys and challenges of planning.



**Emotionally navigating failure**: Grounding yourself through an exercise like a body scan \(link here\) can significantly help in helping the experience of dealing with failure. While we try not to equate failure with learning, we do recognise that failure can often come with a stigma or emotion of shame. Journeying with a trusted staff member/mentor with this struggle is highly recommended. One on one as well as group discussions are encouraged in terms of navigating failure in a task or in relationship with someone. Our training on Non-violent Communication \(link\) is highly encouraged.
