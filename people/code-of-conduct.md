# Code of Conduct

### Grace Cafe CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS FOR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS

As Adopted on 2021-06-14

Grace Cafe \(collectively with its subsidiaries, "Grace Cafe”, “we”, “our”\) is committed to the highest standards of legal and ethical business conduct and has long operated its business consistent with written operating principles and policies that reinforce this commitment. This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics \(this “Code”\) adopted by Grace Cafe’s Board of Directors \(the “Board”\), acting through authority delegated to its Board \(the “Board”\), summarizes the ethical standards for all directors, officers, employees and contractors of Grace Cafe and of its direct and indirect subsidiaries \(“Team Members”\) and is a reminder of the seriousness of our commitment to our values. Compliance with this Code is mandatory for every Team Member. In addition to this Code, Team Members are subject to and must comply with other policies and programs of Grace Cafe, as applicable.

### I. INTRODUCTION

Our business is complex in terms of the contexts and cultures in which we function and the laws with which we must comply. To help Team Members understand what is expected of them and to carry out their responsibilities, we have created this Code. Responsibility for overseeing adherence to this Code shall rest with the Managing Director of Grace Cafe \(“MD”\), as instructed by the Board.

This Code is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to all of our policies or to all responsibilities under law or regulation. All Team Members are expected to be familiar with applicable laws and regulations in their area of operation, and Grace Cafe expressly prohibits any activity by Team Members that violates any applicable law or regulation. This Code is a guideline, or a minimum requirement, that must always be followed.

We expect each Team Member to read and become familiar with the ethical standards described in this Code. Violations of the law, our corporate policies, or this Code may result in disciplinary action, including dismissal.

### II. KEY CORPORATE VALUES

Grace Cafe values and wishes to hold its Team Members to a code of conduct that seeks alignment with the following key corporate values. Please refer to our values.

### III. FAIR DEALING

Team Members are required to deal honestly, ethically and fairly with students, partners, suppliers, community members and other third parties. We:

* prohibit bribes, kickbacks or any other form of improper payment, direct or indirect, to any representative of a government, labour union, student or supplier in order to obtain a contract, some other commercial benefit or government action;
* prohibit Team Members from accepting any bribe, kickback or improper payment from anyone;
* prohibit gifts or favours to or from any student or supplier, except for promotional material of nominal value and gifts of modest value that are related to commonly recognised events or occasions; limit marketing and client entertainment expenditures to those that are necessary, prudent, job related and consistent with our policies;
* require clear and precise communication in our contracts, advertising, literature and other public statements and seek to eliminate misstatement of fact or misleading impressions; reflect accurately on all invoices to students the sale price and terms of sale for products and services sold or rendered;
* Under the Protection of Personal Information Act \(POPIA\) we protect all proprietary data our students, partners or suppliers provide to us as reflected in our agreements with them or as compelled by law; and prohibit our representatives from otherwise taking unfair advantage of our students, partners or suppliers, or other third parties, through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information or any other unfair-dealing practice.

### IV. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Grace Cafe recognises and respects Team Members' rights to engage in outside activities that they may deem proper and desirable, provided that these activities do not impair or interfere with the performance of their duties to Grace Cafe or their ability to act in Grace Cafe’s best interests. However, all Team Members must avoid situations in which their personal interests may conflict, or appear to conflict, with the interests of Grace Cafe.

It is not possible to list every situation that might give rise to a conflict of interest, but the information that follows serves as a guide, pointing out important areas where conflicts may arise. The responsibility for conduct within the letter and the spirit of this Code regarding conflicts of interest rests with each individual. It is, however, important to avoid not only any situation that is an obvious conflict of interest, but also to be aware of situations that might appear to be a conflict.

Additionally, Team Members are subject to Grace Cafe’s Related Party Transaction Policy. Team Members shall not conduct business on behalf of Grace Cafe with a relative or a business entity with which the Team Member or a relative is associated, except where such dealings have been approved and is granted pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Related Party Transaction Policy.

#### Use of Grace Cafe Property

In the absence of prior Grace Cafe approval, assets of Grace Cafe should be used for legitimate business purposes and for personal purposes only to the extent allowed by Grace Cafe policy. All Team Members have an obligation to use Grace Cafe property efficiently and to report any theft or damage to Grace Cafe property to appropriate Grace Cafe management personnel.

By using any Grace Cafe electronic equipment or systems or by accessing the Internet or any Grace Cafe intranet using a Grace Cafe sign-on ID or any Grace Cafe computer equipment or systems, a Team Member acknowledges that he or she represents Grace Cafe and agrees to comply with our Internal Acceptable Use Policy. The Internal Acceptable Use Policy specifies requirements related to the use of Grace Cafe computing resources and data assets by Team Members so as to protect Grace Cafe and its students, Team Members, contractors, and other partners from harm caused by both deliberate and inadvertent misuse.

#### Dealings with Partners, Suppliers and Competitors

Team Members shall select and deal with suppliers, students, partners and other persons doing or seeking to do business with Grace Cafe in an impartial manner, without favor or preference based upon any considerations other than the best interests of Grace Cafe. Team Members shall not seek or accept, directly or indirectly, any payments, fees, services, or loans from any person or business entity that does or seeks to do business with Grace Cafe. This does not, however, prohibit a Team Member from receiving compensation for outside services that Grace Cafe permits such a person to render, when such outside services will not affect the impartial discharge of such person’s duties or obligations to Grace Cafe. In the absence of prior Grace Cafe approval, with regard to any person or business entity that does or seeks to do business with Grace Cafe, Team Members shall not seek or accept for themselves, or any member of their families, any gifts, entertainment, or other favors of a character that goes beyond common courtesies consistent with ethical and accepted business practices and are consistent with our internal policies.

#### Interests In or Relationships with Other organisations

Team Members shall not accept a directorship or other managerial position in, or serve as a consultant or employee of, a business entity, organized for profit, that does or seeks to do business with, or is in competition with, Grace Cafe, without receiving specific approval from their direct supervisor.

#### Loans

Grace Cafe shall not make any loans to Team Members unless the Board approves them. No supervisor shall solicit a loan from a subordinate or accept a loan from a subordinate. In no event shall Grace Cafe make a loan to any member of the Board or to any officer of Grace Cafe.

#### Reporting Obligations

Team Members shall report in writing to their direct supervisor any personal ownership interest or other relationship that might affect their ability to exercise impartial, ethical business judgments in their area of responsibility. Each situation reported shall be reviewed by the Team Member’s supervisor, and the supervisor shall make a determination, with guidance from the Compliance Officer, as to whether a conflict of interest exists or may arise from such a situation. All Team Members shall give Grace Cafe their fullest cooperation in the correction of any situation in which a conflict exists or may arise. If the Team Member to whom the ownership interest or relationship relates is an officer of Grace Cafe, such relationship shall be reviewed by the MD in the manner prescribed by Grace Cafe’s Related Party Transaction Policy.

### V. CONFIDENTIALITY AND CORPORATE ASSETS AND CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES

Team Members are, on occasion, entrusted with Grace Cafe confidential information and with the confidential information of Grace Cafe suppliers, students or other business partners. This information may include: \(1\) technical information about current and future services; \(2\) business or marketing plans or projections; \(3\) earnings and other internal financial data; \(4\) personnel information; \(5\) supply and student lists; and \(6\) other non-public information. This information is the property of Grace Cafe, or the property of its suppliers, students or business partners, and in many cases was developed at great expense. All Team Members, upon commencement of employment with Grace Cafe, shall sign offer letters or contractor agreements that contain confidentiality provisions \(the “Confidentiality Agreement”\) provided by Grace Cafe. Strict adherence to the Confidentiality Agreement is required of each Team Member.

Team Members shall not take for themselves, or for family members or any other entities with which they are affiliated, any opportunity of which they become aware through the use of Grace Cafe property or information, or through their position with Grace Cafe, and shall not use Grace Cafe property or information, or their position with Grace Cafe, for personal gain other than actions taken for the overall advancement of the interests of Grace Cafe.

### VI. SPECIAL ETHICS OBLIGATIONS FOR TEAM MEMBERS WITH FINANCIAL REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES

The Managing Director, and Finance Department personnel bear a special responsibility for promoting integrity throughout the organisation, with responsibilities to stakeholders both inside and outside of Grace Cafe. The Managing Director, and members of the Finance Department have a special role not only to adhere to these principles themselves but also to ensure that a culture exists throughout Grace Cafe as a whole that ensures the fair, accurate, comprehensive and timely reporting of financial results. Because of this special role, the Managing Director, all members of the Finance Department and all other Team Members, must:

* act with honesty and integrity, avoiding actual or apparent conflicts of interest in personal and professional relationships;
* provide information that is accurate, complete, objective, timely and understandable to ensure full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that Grace Cafe files with, or submits to, government agencies and in other public communications;
* comply with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations, and acquire appropriate knowledge of such laws, rules and regulations relating to Grace Cafe' duties sufficient to enable the Team Member to recognise potential dangers and to know when to seek legal advice;
* promptly report to the MD and/or the Chairman of the Board any conduct believed to be a violation of law or business ethics or of any provision of this Code, including any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to such a conflict; and
* promote accountability to this Code among all Team Members.



### VII. COMPLIANCE WITH ALL LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS

Grace Cafe will comply with all laws and governmental regulations that are applicable to its activities and expects all Team Members to obey the law. Specifically, Grace Cafe is committed to:

* maintaining a safe and healthy work environment;
* promoting a work environment that is free from discrimination or harassment based on race, colour, sex, age, national origin, disability or sexual preference;
* supporting fair competition and laws prohibiting restraints of trade and other unfair trade practices;
* full compliance with applicable environmental laws; prohibiting any illegal payments, gifts, or gratuities to any government official, political party or student; prohibiting the unauthorised use, reproduction, communication or distribution of any third party’s trade secrets, copyrighted information or confidential information; and
* complying with all applicable state and federal securities laws.

### VIII. QUESTIONS, REPORTING AND EFFECT OF VIOLATIONS

Compliance with this Code is, first and foremost, the individual responsibility of every Team Member. Grace Cafe attempts to foster a work environment in which ethical issues and concerns may be raised and discussed with supervisors or with others without fear of retribution.

If a Team Member is aware of a suspected or actual violation of this Code by others, he or she has **a responsibility to report it** in accordance with the procedures outlined below. The Team Member and Grace Cafe will be best served by bringing the concern into the open so that any problems can be resolved quickly, and more serious harm is prevented. Grace Cafe will not allow any retaliation against any Team Member who acts in good faith in reporting any violation of this Code or against any person who is assisting in good faith in any investigation or process with respect to such a report. Any Team Member who participates in any such retaliation is subject to disciplinary action, including termination.

Grace Cafe offers Team Members many ways to get answers to their questions about ethical issues and to raise any concern about a possible violation of this Code:

* Generally, each Team Member’s direct supervisor or manager \(or another supervisor or manager\) will be in the best position to resolve the issue quickly.
* If after raising an ethics or conduct concern the issue is not resolved, raise it with Grace Cafe’s People Group or MD.
* Team Members can raise their concerns orally or in writing.

While Grace Cafe prefers that each Team Member gives his or her name and other pertinent information when making a report because it makes the investigation and resolution of the suspected violations being reported more effective and efficient, if Team Members prefer they may also make a report anonymously.

Team Members who violate any law, governmental regulation or this Code will face appropriate, case-specific disciplinary action, which may include demotion or discharge. Violating this Code may also mean breaking the law, subjecting such employees and/or Grace Cafe to criminal penalties \(fines or prison sentences\) or civil sanctions \(damage awards or fines\).
