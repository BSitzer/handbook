# Mission and Vision

### Background

We believe in a world where **everyone can contribute**. We believe that all content should be open to contributions; from legal documents to curriculum scripts, and from websites to graphic designs.

Allowing everyone to make a proposal is an important aspect of life at Grace Cafe. No invite needed: if you can see it, you can contribute.

### Mission

Our mission is for Grace Cafe to be one of the best learning experiences for its students in the world.   


### Vision

Grace Cafe becomes a space where the surrounding community are greatly influenced in a positive way and at a holistic level.
