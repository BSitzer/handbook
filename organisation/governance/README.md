# Governance

At Grace Cafe, we use Sociocracy as our governance methodology. Moreover, we are members of [Sociocracy For All](https://sociocracyforall.org/) who help us apply the methodology in our context. 

**What is Sociocracy?**

Sociocracy, also called dynamic governance, is a system of governance which seeks to create psychologically safe environments and productive organisations. It is distinguished by the use of consent, rather than majority voting, in discussion and decision-making by people who have a shared objective or work process.

Once you join Grace Cafe will be allocated various training content to help you understand and utilise the sociocratic methodology in your organisational life.

Depending on your team role, you will also be allocated to certain groups, called circles. Your manager would take you through this process step by step.
