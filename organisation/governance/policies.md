# Policies

### Conflict Resolution Policy

Adult Conflict : Safety - when someone walks into the building without permission and bulling. Normal Conflict : Kitchen Conflict - like leaving my plate or forgetting to wash my cup and name calling.

Here are the steps y'all proposed in our session last week. Remember we are attaching values to our steps for conflict. We decided these are the steps for conflict that needs an adult to help solve.&#x20;

**Adult conflict:**

1. Call an adult \[ Protection ]
2. Calm the people involved \[ Contentment ]
3. Call the circle A.S.A.P \[ Responsibility ]
4. Say values
5. Ask everyone how they feeling \[ Respect ]
6. If passing the facilitator puts meeting on hold and reschedule
7. Give everyone an opportunity to speak \[ Vulnerability ]
8. Ask what they think should happen \[ Humanity ]
9. Try to find middle ground \[ Open-minded ]
10. Ask for approval \[ Care ]
11. Ask how they feel \[ Connection ]
12. Conflict resolved \[ Forgiveness ]



**Normal Conflict.**

1. Calm yourself down by breathing exercise-Self awareness&#x20;
2. Approach person and ask to talk.-Bravery&#x20;

### Social space proposal

Computer area is for quietness. The couches and coffee area is for conversations.

### Cleaning list review at 3pm

Gabby doing the review



### Procedure for isolation room

When someone shows flu-like symptoms, they need to immediately be confined to the office. Cam or someone he asks will then ensure that transport is organised for the person back home. Once they leave, the office will then be wiped down and the whole space wiped down with jik to clean the space. The person would ideally then get tested for covid. If they are positive for covid then the whole team will need to self-isolate for 14 days and get tested as well.



### Before pizza making starts, to agree on who is making the pizza and who is cleaning the kitchen

Consequence?



### Kitchen policy

Keep kitchen clean.

Wash, dry and pack away dishes.

If you spot something dirty, clean it.

Also try to encourage those clearly struggling with cleaning to clean.

No consequences listed. Leave the kitchen space the way you found it or better.

Those on the sweeping schedule should also wipe the counters and mop the kitchen floor. It is up to them to decide who does which task that day.
