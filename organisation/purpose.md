# Purpose

Grace Cafe’s purpose is to create **healing communities** as disciples of **Jesus**.  
  
Healing communities are geographical locations or online locations where individuals are committed to understanding their purpose in life from a general and specific perspective and helping others understand it too.  


Being disciples of Jesus when you learn from and obey the teachings of Jesus on a personal and social level. Jesus being the person on which the Christian Bible centres on. Our focus is not only on his teachings but also on who he is as a person and how He lived His life as we try to imitate Him.  


We use the framework by [J-Life](http://jlife.org) to guide us to live out this purpose. Our values, mission, vision, strategies and organisational culture aspirations are all guided by our purpose. During onboarding, team members will go through J-Life training.

From J-Life’s website: “At J-Life, we believe that the best way to bring about lasting life transformation is through life-on-life discipling, which requires disciplemakers to go deep with each person they are discipling. The more time that is spent in close relationship with disciples, the more the DNA of Christ will be transferred. J-Life seeks to mobilise disciples who will live their lives in such a way, that communities in Africa are transformed by the life of Christ and the Father is glorified.”
