# History of Grace Cafe

### Grace Café: a partnership between Grace2Learn and St Luke's in Rocklands 

In 2018 an offer from St Luke’s church allowed the Grace2Learn team to use the church building in Rocklands. This was the beginning of the partnership and the start of the Community Learning hub, which is running as part of the church structure.\


Initially, the learning hub was the operating space for the Grace2Learn team, a team of four. The learning hub was officially named “Grace Cafe” by one of the church and community members, Matthew van Neel. The learning hub started running the GED, Matric equivalent accreditation, at the hub with one student at a time. A full-time 9-5pm, Monday to Friday commitment for students, it was a time of lots of learning for the team. After a few months of this, we had the prayer to grow and offer it to a few more students in the community. \


### The Covid Crisis: a blessing in disguise

When the pandemic declared itself in 2020 and schools were shut down, many parents started to see the Grace Café as an alternative for their children’s education – one that would allow them to continue learning even if the schools were closed.

This led to a growth in enrolment, with as many as 5 students enrolled for the GED. The growth

continued in 2021 with 10 students currently part of the Learning Hub and two remote students, doing the GED from home. Three of those students are interns, post-Matric students working on skills development.\
