# How do we reinforce our values

Whatever behaviour you reward will become your values. We reinforce our values by:

1. What we expect from all team members, as ambassadors for our values.
2. What we refer to when making decisions.
3. The example the management group sets for the organisation since a fish rots from the head down.
4. What we select for during staff/student recruitment.
5. What we emphasise during on-boarding.
6. Behaviour we give each other feedback on.
7. Behaviour we compliment.
8. Criteria we use for promotions.
9. Criteria we use to manage under-performance.
10. What we do when we let people go.
11. ~~Our Grace Cafe Song Book~~ \(not created yet\), the song lyrics often mention Grace Cafe values.
12. Applying one of our values virtual backgrounds in video calls.
13. Linking the takeaways of courses to our values.
14. The default settings of the software we use \(for example: Speedy meetings, document sharing, agendas, etc.\)

The most important moments to reinforce our values are decisions which affect individual team members most: staff/student hiring, onboarding, promotion and getting to mastery in learning, which is why every promotion document at Grace Cafe is shared \(coming soon\) with the entire organisation and uses the values as its core structure.

In negative feedback, we should be specific about what the problem is. For example, saying someone is "not living the values" isn't helpful.

Your values are what you hire for, what you praise people for, and what you promote them for. By definition, what you do in those instances are your values. It's not what you say they are. Values should be explicitly part of our hiring process, our job profiles, and our review process.

When we give incentives and promotions, they are always linked to values. That's the crucial thing. If you reinforce them there, that's the most powerful thing you can do. 



**What to do if values aren't being lived out**

Value erosion can occur when indifference and apathy are tolerated. It can also occur when individuals justify undesired behaviours by interpreting values as "me values" rather than "organisation values." For example, a team member may speak to the importance of personal efficiency in order to justify not collaborating professionally with peers. This is not what we expect from team members in terms of efficiency and collaboration.

If you feel that values are not being lived out in a given scenario, speak up and ask for context in a respectful manner. Navigating value conflicts starts with assuming positive intent from other team members. Offer links to relevant values and/or sub-values when discussing the issue. If there is confusion or disagreement about the interpretation of a value, please surface the discussion in Grace Cafeâ€™s \#values Slack channel.

Almost every time we face a hard decision at Grace Cafe, it's because values are in conflict. It's not binary logic. It requires conversation, and sometimes there is no obvious answer. We can only achieve resolution by respectfully talking with each other and trusting the DRI \(directly responsible individual\) to make the ultimate decision.
