# Belonging

🌐 

Creating a sense of belonging is fundamental to the success of Grace Cafe. As a body of believers in Jesus, we aim to make a significant impact in our efforts to foster an environment where everyone can thrive. Recognising that total inclusion is not possible and that there will be boundary lines for those we might exclude, for example, those who don’t share our values. Our unique Christ-following lens is a key motivating factor for why we do what we do, which will also result in exclusion as not everyone holds this view. While we aim to serve anyone including non-Chiristians, our staff team make-up will be only with those who believe in the saving work of Jesus. We are designing a multidimensional approach to ensure that Grace Cafe is a place where people from every background and circumstance feel like they belong and can contribute. We actively chose to build and institutionalise a culture that is inclusive and supports all team members equally in the process of achieving their professional goals. We work to make everyone feel welcome and to increase the participation of underrepresented people in our community and organisation.  


### Sub-Values 

### Bias towards asynchronous communication \(communication not in real-time\)

Take initiative to operate asynchronously whenever possible. This shows care and consideration for those who are structuring their day around pressing commitments at home or in their community.   


This is demonstrated by communicating recordings of meetings, using Grace Cafe Trello boards and Slack messages rather than in-person chatting and voice or video calls, and being sensitive to local holidays and vacation statuses. Encourage others to default to documentation rather than pressuring others to be online outside of their working hours.  


### Embracing uncomfortable ideas and conversations

Part of embracing a sense of belonging is a willingness to embrace often uncomfortable conversations and situations. This concept is also at the core of inclusion and helping to eliminate the problems that are faced by certain Grace Cafe team members who may not be in the majority. We want to celebrate our diversity, not hide it.  


We believe that being willing to embrace discomfort is the path forward to a brave, balanced and inclusive workplace for all. Challenge yourself, challenge your own pre-set notions and ideas about different cultures or things you don't understand. When we are willing to embrace being uncomfortable, we can focus on actually fixing the issues at hand rather than simply "appearing to care".  


### Reach across organisation

We encourage Grace Cafe team members to seek and provide feedback across the organisation. This enables the team to iterate more quickly, taking a more diverse perspective into account.  


### Shift working hours for a cause

Caregiving, outreach programs, and community service do not conveniently wait for regular business hours to conclude. If there's a cause or community effort taking place, feel welcome to work with your manager and shift your working hours to be available during a period where you'll have the greatest impact for good. For colleagues supporting others during these causes, document everything and strive to post recordings so it's easy for them to catch up.  


### Be a mentor

People feel more included when they're supported. To encourage this, and to support diversified learning across the team, consider Grace Cafe's Mentorship program.  


### Culture fit is a bad excuse

We don't hire based on culture or select candidates because we'd like to have a drink with them. We hire and reward team members based on our shared values as detailed on this page. We want a values fit, not a culture fit. We want cultural diversity instead of cultural conformity, such as an “Old Boys” atmosphere. Said differently: "culture add" &gt; "culture fit" or "hire for culture contribution" since our mission is that everyone can contribute.  


### Quirkiness

Unexpected and unconventional things make life more interesting. Celebrate and encourage quirky gifts, habits, behaviour, and points of view. We try to hire people who think work is a great way to express themselves.  


### Building a brave community

Do not make jokes or unfriendly remarks about characteristics of the people who make up Grace Cafe. Everyone has the right to feel safe when working for Grace Cafe and/or as a part of the Grace Cafe community. We do not tolerate abuse, harassment, exclusion, discrimination, or retaliation by/of any community members, including our team members. You can always refuse to deal with people who treat you badly and get out of situations that make you feel uncomfortable. We cannot guarantee a completely safe environment, we are all broken after all, and we could unknowingly say something that makes someone else feel unsafe at any given moment. We therefore invite our team members to create a “brave space” environment.  


### Unconscious bias

We recognise that unconscious bias is something that affects everyone and that the effect it has on us as humans and our organisation is large. We are responsible for understanding our own implicit biases and helping others understand theirs. We are continuously working on getting better at this topic.  


### Inclusive interviewing

`This is documented on our page about interviewing.`  


### Inclusive meetings

We use a [sociocractic meeting methodology](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/meeting-format/). Be consciously inclusive in meetings by giving everyone an opportunity to talk and present their points of view. This can be especially important in a remote setting.  


### See Something, Say Something

We have team members from many different backgrounds and cultures. That means it is important for each of us to use great judgement in being respectful and inclusive of our teammates. At the same time, we may sometimes not fully realise we have said or done something to offend someone. It is important that our teammates hold each other accountable and let them know if they have unintentionally or intentionally done something so they can learn and gain additional understanding of perspectives different from our own. It is also important that our teammates don't feel excluded or minimised by the words we use or the things we do. Thus, we all need to speak up when we see something that isn't respectful or inclusive.  


### Neurodiversity

Neurodiversity is a type of diversity that includes: autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, and other styles of neurodivergent functioning. While neurodivergent individuals often bring unique skills and abilities which can be harnessed for competitive advantage in many fields including cyber-security, neurodivergent individuals are often discriminated against, and sometimes have trouble making it through traditional hiring processes. These individuals should be able to contribute as Grace Cafe team members. The handbook, values, strategy, and interviewing process should never discriminate against the neurodivergent.  


### God first, family and friends second, work third

Long-lasting relationships are the rocks of life, and come before work. Someone might say in our \#thanks channel after helping a family member: "THANK YOU to Grace Cafe for providing a culture where "God first" is truly meant". Use the hashtag: \#GodFirst

That is when we are really living it out.
