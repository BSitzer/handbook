# Five Dysfunctions of a team



Our values help us to prevent the [five dysfunctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Five\_Dysfunctions\_of\_a\_Team#Summary):\


1. **Absence of trust:** Unwilling to be vulnerable within the group => prevented by collaboration, specifically kindness
2. **Fear of conflict:** Seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate => prevented by transparency, specifically directness and collaboration, specifically short toes
3. **Lack of commitment:** Feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organisation => prevented by transparency, specifically directness
4. **Avoidance of accountability:** Ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards => prevented by results, iteration, and transparency
5. **Inattention to results:** Focusing on personal success, status, and ego before team success => prevented by results

Some dysfunctions are not addressed directly by our values; for example, trust is not one of our values. Similar to happiness, trust is something that is an outcome, not something you can strive for directly. We hope that the way we work and our values will instil trust, instead of mandating it from people; trust is earned, not given.
