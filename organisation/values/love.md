# Love

❤ 

“We love because he first loved us.” 1 John 4:19. Jesus says that the most important command is this: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. The second is this: ‘Love your neighbour as yourself. There is no commandment greater than these.” Mark 12:30-31

We care about the people we work with, once people are feeling loved they are able to love others. This enables us to achieve more progress, which makes our work more fulfilling.

### Listening

When we take the time to listen to God, ourselves and others well, we eliminate a lot of misconceptions and save significant time in moving the organisation forward. We practice Christian listening methodology by the training of [Aloe Christian Foundation](https://www.aloe.org.za/).   


### Self-service and self-learning

Service and learning to ourselves is a practice of self-love. As we grow in these areas we are better able to help others in self-love too. We are to love others as we love ourselves.  


### Frugality

We can show love to Grace Cafe’s sustainability if we try to accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense."   


### Trust

We believe that collaboration moves at the speed of trust \(Peter Drucker\). We also believe that trust develops one conversation at a time. Therefore, quality and intentional time spent together is a golden resource at Grace Cafe. The development of trust is a great proactive way to resolve conflict.  


### Managers of one

We want each team member to be a manager of one who doesn't need daily check-ins to achieve their goals.  


### Freedom and responsibility over rigidity

“There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. The one who fears has not been perfected in love.” 1 John 4:18. We also believe there is great freedom in love. When possible, we give people the responsibility to make a decision and hold them accountable for that, instead of imposing rules and approval processes. You should have clear objectives and the freedom to work on them as you see fit. Freedom and responsibility are more efficient than rigidly following a process, or creating interdependencies, because they enable faster decision velocity and higher rates of iteration.  
  


### Identity

We should remember that our identity is in Jesus. We are not our mistakes and we are loved despite our mistakes. Not every problem should lead to a new process to prevent them. Additional processes make all actions more inefficient; a mistake only affects one.  


### Embrace change

Fall in love with the process, not the end-product. Adoption of processes, activities, and the education and community landscape change frequently and rapidly. The most successful organisations adapt their roadmap and their organisation quickly to keep pace. One of the things that makes this challenging is the impact on our team. People may need to fulfil new roles and responsibilities or who they are mentoring or supporting. This can rightly feel disruptive. If we coach ourselves to embrace the positive aspects of change, such as increased opportunity and new things to learn, we can move faster as an organisation and increase our odds of success. It is important to hold management accountable for being deliberate.  


### Say why, not just what

As we create a climate of love, reasons for a change \(why\) should be laid out clearly along with the change details itself \(what\). This leads to fewer questions later on because people already have some understanding. A change with no public explanation can lead to a lot of extra rounds of questioning, which is less efficient.  


This also helps with institutional memory: a year from now when you want to know why a decision was made, or not, the issue or change requester that influenced the decision also shares why the decision was made. It's much easier to suggest removing or changing something if you know why it exists in the first place.  


Avoid using terms such as "industry standard" or "best practices" as they are vague, opaque, and don't provide enough context as a reason for a change.  


Similarly, merely stating a single value isn't a great explanation for why we are making a particular decision. Many things could be considered "love" or "collaboration" that don't match our definition of those values. Try to link to a sub-value of the value or provide more context, instead of just saying a single value's name.  


Saying why and not just what enables discussion around topics that may impact more than one value; for instance, when weighing the collaborative of exploration of solutions with the focus on exam results. When decisions align with all of our values, they are easy to discuss and decide. When there are multiple values involved, using our values hierarchy and directly discussing the tradeoffs is easier with more context.  


Articulating why also helps people understand how something changed when you articulate that you changed your mind.  


Saying why does not mean justifying a decision against all other suggestions. **The directly responsible individual \(DRI\)** is responsible for their decision. The DRI is not responsible for convincing other people, but they should be able to articulate their reasoning for the change.  


When a Grace Cafe Team Member comes across an issue request \(policy, handbook, etc.\) that does not provide a "why" with sufficient context, the Team Member is responsible for getting the why and, if needed, working with the DRI to ensure that it is adequately documented and communicated to give context to other team members. In the absence of a why, team members may speculate the why. This is something that can lead to disruption and mission-drift.  


### Transparency

Being open and honest can breed a culture of love. Be open about as many things as possible. By making information public, we can reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier. Use public issue trackers, projects, and repositories when possible.  


An example is the public repository of this website that also contains this organisation handbook. Everything we do is public by default, such as the Grace Cafe issue trackers, as well as marketing and learning. Transparency creates awareness for Grace Cafe, allows us to recruit people that care about our values, gets us more and faster feedback from people outside the organisation, and makes it easier to collaborate with them. It is also about sharing great learning strategies, physical resources, lessons, and processes with the whole community and the world in the spirit of open source, which we believe creates more value than it captures.  


There are exceptions. Material that is not public by default is documented. We are above average at keeping things confidential that need to be. On a personal level, you should tell it like it is instead of putting up a poker face. Don't be afraid to admit you made a mistake or were wrong. When something goes wrong, it is a great opportunity to say "What’s the learning moment here?" and find a better way without hurt feelings.  


### Value dissent

We need to love each other in good times and difficult times. In a group setting, participants may disagree with a proposal but not articulate their views for one reason or another. As a result, everyone loses out on their feedback. Dissent is an expression of that disagreement, however, it can be difficult and even socially expensive. Expression of feedback is a way for everyone to grow and learn, and is based on facts rather than opinions. Share your perspective, rather than agreeing simply to avoid conflict or to go along with everyone else.  


### Articulate when you change your mind

If you state one thing, and then change course and support a different direction, point, or outcome, articulate this. It is OK to have your position changed by new data. Articulating that an earlier stance is not your current stance provides clarity to others and encourages data-driven decision making.  


### Anyone and anything can be questioned

Any past decisions and guidelines are open to questioning as long as you act in accordance with them until they are changed.
