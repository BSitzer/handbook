# Values

Grace Cafe’s five core values are: 

❤ Love 

🌐 Belonging

📈 Results

👣 Iteration

🤝 Collaboration 

and together they spell L-BRIC. We react to them with the **values emoji** and they are made actionable below.

### About our values

Grace Cafe’s values are a living document. In many instances, they have been documented, refined, and revised based on lessons learned \(and scars earned\) in the course of living out the organisation rhythms. Our [mission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EwgifcOLCrCQyxDu7PlHl4zeGPLn0cK2EAPR9yTjEHw/edit#heading=h.yy1g7p5igdv6) guides our path, and we live our [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) along this path.  


Everyone is welcome to suggest improvements. Please @mention our MD in Slack in the \#handbook channel.

### Sub-values as substantiators

The "sub" in sub-value is not in reference to "subordinate," but rather, "substantiate the core values."  


Sub-values clarify what a given core value means and looks like at Grace Cafe. Understanding this distinction is critical to thriving at Grace Cafe, particularly for newer team members who may be familiar with a prior organisation's interpretation of iteration or collaboration \(as examples\).
