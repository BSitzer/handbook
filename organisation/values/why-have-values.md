# Why have values

Our values should give guidelines on how to behave and must be actionable. They help us describe the type of behaviour that we expect from people we hire. They help us to know how to behave in the organisation and what to expect from others. Values are a framework for distributed decision making; they allow you to determine what to do without asking your manager.
