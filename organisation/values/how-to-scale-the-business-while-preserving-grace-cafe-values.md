# How to scale the business while preserving Grace Cafe values?

For certain organisational decisions or projects, Grace Cafe team members may have a lot of opinions and interest, and they want to provide their feedback and comments. On the other hand, it might be challenging for the project DRI to digest and respond to all these inputs. What should you do in this scenario?

Everyone can contribute at Grace Cafe. We encourage team members to share feedback and leave comments on issues. Leaving feedback and comments shows that team members care about a topic and about Grace Cafe as an organisation. These perspectives may also uncover potential risks and problems in the project.

There shouldn't be a “Don’t they have their own work to do?” type of response. Furthermore, we shouldn’t judge team members who are perceived as being the “squeaky wheel.”

At Grace Cafe, we measure results, not hours. As long as a team member is producing required results, they are empowered to decide how to spend their time.

On the other hand, as Grace Cafe grows in size, we need to make decisions and the decisions may not be agreed to by everyone.

If a decision or project is sensitive or controversial, and receives large amounts of feedback, it can be challenging for the project DRI to handle. In these cases, it's best to have time-boxed feedback built into timelines.

In a hypothetical example where a DRI needs to decide between red and gold potatoes for a stew, they would create an issue with the following sentiment:

We’re deciding between red potatoes and gold potatoes to go into the soup. We have to decide by Tuesday 2021-07-14 so that we can get our order to the grocery store on Wednesday 2021-07-15. We’ll be collecting input and feedback until that point. Jane is the DRI and will make the decision on 2021-07-14 with all the information we have at that point. Here is the framework we’re using for the decision:

* _are there allergies to consider?_
* _cost per kilogram_
* _team member preferences_

Once the decision is made, it will be what is going into the stew.

This method has shown itself to be effective at soliciting productive feedback that doesn't derail a timeline while ensuring team members feel heard.
