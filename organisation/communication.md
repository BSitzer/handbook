# Communication

We're a **remote-friendly** organisation that allows people to work from almost anywhere. We hire great people, so it's important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently.

To accomplish this, we use _asynchronous communication_ **as a starting point** and stay as open and transparent as we can by communicating through public issues, policy proposals, and use in-person or _Slack channels_.

We also place an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down to **Trello**. When we go **back and forth three times**, we meet in-person or jump on a _synchronous video call_ via Slack or Google Meet.

We communicate respectfully and professionally at all times.

**Effective & Responsible Communication Guidelines**

1. **Assume Positive Intent**. Always begin with a position of positivity and grace.
2. **Kindness Matters**. You are looking at a screen, but you are really talking to a person. If you wouldn't say it to a person's face, don't send it to them in a text message.
3. **Express Your Thoughts**. We live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on things.
4. **Own It**. If you say it or type it, own it. If it hurts the organisation or an individual, even unintentionally, we encourage you to look at things from other points of view and apologise easily.
5. **Be a Role Model of our Values.**
6. **Feedback is Essential**. It is difficult to know what is appropriate for every one of our team members. We encourage team members to give feedback and receive feedback in a considerate way.
7. **Don't Underestimate a 1:1.** Asynchronous communication \(e.g., via Slack\) is helpful and necessary. In some cases \(e.g., to clarify misunderstandings\) it can be much more effective to jump on a Google Meet video call or chat in-person.
8. **Always Adhere to our `Anti-Harassment Policy` and `Code of Conduct`.** Everyone should be comfortable in their work environment.
9. **Focus on what we can directly influence.** There are many factors we can't directly influence and we should avoid spending time discussing those things. For example, we don't talk about our GED curriculum relevancy because aspects of this are out of our control. Instead, we should focus on our KPIs and growing our understanding of relevant knowledge areas independent of curriculum.

Embracing asynchronous communication and learning to use it effectively requires a mental shift. This can feel unusual or even uncomfortable for those who come from a co-located environment, where in-person meetings and communiques are the norm.

**Everyone is a Moderator**

If you see something that concerns you in Slack, Issues, Proposal Requests, Video, Emails or any other forum, we encourage you to respectfully say something directly to the individual in a 1:1 format. If you are not comfortable reaching out to the individual directly, please reach out to your direct manager to discuss.

**Communication Guidelines**

1. Keep conversations positive, friendly, real, and productive while adding value.
2. If you make a mistake, admit it. Be upfront and be quick with your correction. If you're posting to a blog, you may choose to modify an earlier post. Just make it clear that you have done so.
3. There can be a fine line between healthy debate and explosive reaction. Try to frame what you write to invite differing points of view without inflaming others. You don’t need to respond to every criticism or barb. Be careful and considerate.
4. _Assume positive intent_ and explicitly state the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says before you respond, not a weaker one that's easier to criticise. _Rapoport's Rules_ also implores you to list points of agreement and mention anything you learned.
5. Answer questions, thank people even if it’s just a few words. Make it a two way conversation.
6. Appreciate suggestions and feedback.
7. Don't make promises that you can't keep.
8. Guide students who ask for help or give a suggestion and share links. 
9. When facing negative comments, respond patiently and treat every team member as an individual, people with the strongest opinions can turn into the strongest supporters.
10. By default, discussions in issues and PRs are public and could include participation of wider community members. It is important to make the wider community members feel welcome participating in discussions and sharing their view. Wider community members also submit PRs to help improve our website/handbook and this is often their first contribution to Grace Cafe. We want to make sure that we are responsive to their contributions and thank them for helping improve Grace Cafe.
11. Adhere to the Code of Conduct in all communication. Similarly, expect students to adhere to the same code when communicating with the Grace Cafe team and the rest of the Grace Cafe community. No one should accept being mistreated.

**Avoid Direct messages**

_**Note**: We don't use the term private message, because these direct messages are not inherently private like a phone call or private letter. The messages are potentially accessible by Workspace admins or via Backups. Slack refers to these types of messages as direct messages themselves._

1. When using Slack for work-related purposes, please avoid direct messages. Direct messages discourage collaboration. You might actually be contacting the wrong person, and they cannot easily redirect you to the right person. If the person is unavailable at the moment, it is less efficient because other people cannot jump in and help. Use a channel and mention the person or group you want to reach. This ensures it is easy for other people to chime in, involve other people if needed, and learn from whatever is discussed.
2. If someone sends you a work-related direct message, it is okay to let them know you'd like to take the conversation to a public channel, linking to this section of the handbook. The process might look something like:
3. In the direct message: _Thanks for reaching out, that's a great question/idea I think the rest of the team could benefit from. I'm going to move this to \#public-channel based on \[our desire to avoid direct messages\]\(/handbook/communication/\#avoid-direct-messages\)_
4. In the appropriate public channel: _@Person asked "question" in a DM, pulling that out here if anyone else has input._ 
5. Answer the question in a thread on that channel message, allowing others to benefit.
6. If you find yourself getting a lot of direct messages that should go in a public channel, consider changing your Slack status to an attention grabbing emoji and set it to something like:
7. _Please consider posting in a public channel before direct messaging_
8. _Why direct message me when you can post in a public channel?_
9. If you must send a work-related direct message, don't start a conversation with "Hi" or "Hey" as that interrupts their work without communicating anything. If you have a quick question, just ask the question directly, and the person will respond asynchronously. If you truly need to have a synchronous communication, then start by asking for that explicitly, while mentioning the subject. e.g., "I'm having trouble understanding issue \#x, can we talk about it quickly?".

**Do not use group direct messages**

Use private channels instead of group direct messages. Group direct messages are very hard to maintain, track, and respond to. They also have a key limitation in that you can't add people to the conversation. This is a hindrance to collaboration and transparency.

Consider whether the conversation can take place in a public channel. If not, please use a private channel instead. This channel may have a short-term purpose. It is acceptable to leave the channel and/or archive it if you are no longer an active participant or the channel is no longer in use.

**Be respectful of your own time**

1. You should try to avoid information overload in order to be productive and efficient with your time. While it can be tempting to read every message in every Slack channel you subscribe to, it’s very challenging, not expected, and not necessary.
2. One method for avoiding Slack overload is to focus your Slack reading on Starred channels and Threads. Starred channels are like "favourites" and allow you to follow messages from those channels easily. Threads consist of any conversation in which you are mentioned and allow you to easily track conversations in which you have direct involvement.
3. **Use your notification settings liberally. Depending on how you use Slack this could range from limiting notifications to critical messages outside of your working hours to turning off Slack notifications entirely. Find the right balance for you and stick to it.**

**Be respectful of others' time**

1. Start by understanding what we mean by respecting time. We should err toward putting material into channels over DMs and public channels over private channels even though we understand that this will generate more messages that can be read by more people. Respecting time is not about reducing the overall volume of channel messages that team members receive. It's about making sure that messages are targeted, expectations for asynchronous responses are clear, and we are communicating with consideration. The following tips provide ways to work respectfully with others given this context.
2. If you're only referring to someone, but don't actually need their attention, and want to spare them from getting notified, spell out their name normally without @ mentioning them.
3. Slack messages should be considered asynchronous communication, and you should not expect an instantaneous response; you have no idea what the other person is doing.
4. You may receive Slack mentions at any time of day. Please consider enabling Slack's Do not disturb functionality so you don't get interrupted, for example, in your offtime. You can also use Slack's Notification schedule tool, this can be found in Slack's Preferences tab. To access this, open slack, hover your cursor at the top of your screen, click slack, then preferences, under the notifications tab you will see notification schedule. This tool allows you to pick what days / times you get notifications.
5. Do not feel obligated to respond to Slack messages when you are not working.
6. Feel free to send a colleague a link to these guidelines if the communication in Slack should be done **asynchronously**.
7. **Please avoid using @here or @channel unless this is about something urgent and important.** In chat, try to keep the use of keywords that mention the whole channel to a minimum. They should only be used for pings that are both urgent and important, not just important. By overusing channel mentions, you make it harder to respond to personal mentions promptly since people get pinged too frequently. Additionally, if you are planning to @mention a specific team \(Slack student Group\), consider the size of the group you are mentioning \(see group membership\) and the impact of pinging all of these people for the particular situation. If something is urgent and important:                          Use @here to notify all currently active members in the room. Please only use @here if the message is important and urgent.                                                                                                                                    Use @channel to notify ALL members in the room, irrespective of away status. Please only use @channel if the message is important and urgent.
8. If you are aware that your teammate is on vacation, avoid mentioning them in a high volume channel. It will be difficult to find the information or question when they return. If you need to ensure they refer back to the thread, ensure to send them a link to the relevant Slack message through a direct message.

**Managing noise and creating focus in Slack**

Slack can be a disorderly place in its default state. Consider implementing the below to add structure and focus, but remember that there will likely be more useful information shared on Slack than you are able to ingest and process on a daily basis, regardless of your approach.

While an intentional effort to organise is important, remember that it's impossible to know everything. As a team, we may spot information that is missed by others, and we should surface that information when pertinent as we strive to see others succeed. For managing Slack channels, consider blocking a set period of time to review certain channels that makes the most sense for you \(i.e. multiple times a day, daily, weekly\).

**Organising your Slack sidebar by priority**

Consider using Slack's Starred channel function to spotlight three categories of channels, its Mute function to quiet channels which are pulling your focus away too often, and most importantly, its Mark all messages as read function \(easily toggled by pressing Shift and Esc simultaneously while on a desktop\) to achieve an instantly clear slate.

An example of three spotlight channels approach is below. Slack allows you to organize your sidebar of starred channels with custom sections to visibly raise or lower their priority level, giving you control over what you see first.

Channels important to my role \(e.g. a team member in GED \#ged\)

Channels important to Grace Cafe \(e.g. \#gracecafe\)

Channels important to my interests \(e.g. \#gardening \#coding\)

**Manage your Slack notifications**

Below are helpful links to best practices and tips on managing your notifications and reducing noise in Slack. We encourage you to regularly check your notification settings to ensure you get more notifications of what is important/relevant to you, and less of what isn't.

* Reduce noise in Slack
* Configure Your Notifications
* Guide to Desktop Notifications
* Channel-specific and group DM Notifications
* Display only unread conversations
* Grace Cafe team member Brendan O'leary on how he uses Slack

**Set aside time to work through notifications**

Building dedicated time into your day can help minimise the distractions that Slack can create. Consider using a 15 or 30 minute block in your morning or afternoon to enjoy a cup of coffee and catch up on messages you might have missed. When the time you set comes to an end, get out of the Slack app and move on to your next project. Having a set end time can help you feel more in control, and serves as a reminder that it's impossible to know everything
