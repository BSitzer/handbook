### Life at Grace Cafe

It’s an exciting time to be part of Grace Cafe. We're a fast-growing, remote-friendly team. Here's a look at what you can expect from our culture and remote-friendly environment.

### We connect in circles. Every voice in heard

The way we connect is in the structure of a series of interconnected “circles” through the intentionality of being consent based. The best way to experience this is in our meetings where we often do “rounds”. Rounds is a communication technique to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to contribute. In the sociocracy training we explain how policy request formation happens and how every person in the organisation has the power to impact the way we do things at Grace Cafe.

Our size and our mission (to be one of the best learning hubs in the world) mean that our team members can — and are expected to — make an impact across the organisation.

From your very first week, no matter your role, you'll gain the technical skills needed to access, question, and contribute to projects far beyond your job description.

This unique approach works because we're a team of helpful, passionate people who want to see each other, the organisation, and the broader Grace Cafe community succeed. We learn from each other, challenge each other, and thank each other.

Come prepared to do meaningful work that will help shape the future of the organisation.

While the opportunities to contribute are boundless in a growing organization like Grace Cafe, they may not be clearly defined. You'll need to think creatively, speak up to see how you can help, and be willing to try something new.

### Joy-Fuelled living

Our values, mission and vision all come from our sense of purpose. As the joy we receive is an overflowing joy we receive from God, we have a strong desire to share this joy with others. This joy-fueled life results in a growth journey to becoming mature disciplemakers. These characteristics and priorities overlap physical, emotional, cognitive and spiritual boundaries. They also overlap work, personal and social/community living.&#x20;

### Freedom to iterate

At Grace Cafe, our value of iteration has a unique impact on the way we operate and get things done.

Working this way means our team members are expected to quickly deliver the minimum viable change in their work instead of waiting to produce a polished, completed product.

While this can be a challenging practice to adopt at first, it's liberating to be able to make mistakes, get feedback quickly, and course correct to reach a better outcome, faster.

As our organisation and the industry continue to grow, you'll have the freedom to change and constantly evolve everything from your schedule and your workspace to your job description and your skills.

### Remote-friendly work

At Grace Cafe, we're figuring out a lot of things you have to do to be remote-friendly, and we're trying to share those lessons. That's anything from working handbook-first to communication styles and being intentional about informal communication.

If you Google "Grace Cafe remote-friendly", you'll find tons of tips (not true - yet). And those are based not just on what we say, but what we do. We have a public handbook of over a 100 pages with all our internal processes. You can check out what we really do to make this work.

We think it's going to be the future. And we want to enable that trend. We think it's great for team members.

Being a part of our team offers unique advantages beyond the requisite flexibility you'll find in many organisations.

As a Grace Cafe team member, you can work from anywhere with good internet. Whether you’re an adventurer looking to travel the world while still pursuing your studies, an manager who wants a job that allows you to spend more time with family, or somewhere in between, you'll have the freedom to contribute when and where you do your best work.

Despite all of its benefits for team members, our organisation, and the world, remote work isn't for everyone. Learn more about remote-friendly work at Grace Cafe and decide if it's right for you.

### Culture at Grace Cafe

Culture at Grace Cafe is established in the following ways.

Work style (how we work). This is defined and articulated in our values and handbook.

Camaraderie (mutual trust and friendship). This is created and maintained by informal communication.

In other organisations, culture may be defined through the personality of the group. This includes people who have traits in common and people who you enjoy spending time with. Note that this is not something that should matter when evaluating people for work, and this is not what we mean with Culture at Grace Cafe.

### Non-Violent Communication (NVC)

Under the banner of cnvc.org, we practice NVC or Compassionate Communication. We do the basic level training as part of onboard. The purpose of NVC is to create a quality of connection that results in natural giving.&#x20;

### LK10

When we think of the daily rhythms needed to stay rooted in Jesus, we often get caught up in doing. The LK10 community has a way of thinking about being in relationship with God that is really refreshing and true to scriptural teachings. LK10 is a global initiative that envisions a vibrant family of God within reach of every person on the planet. Their 5 Core Values are characterized by joy-fueled, Jesus-led communities of practice, training spiritual moms and dads to nurture ecosystems of grace. Here’s a closer look at each of these values. We work through their training material in order to develop these healthy rhythms.

### Listening Culture

We really value a strong listening culture at Grace Cafe. We develop this listening culture through the teachings of Jesus and through the training modules of Aloe Christian Foundation. From their website: “There are many people in our society who are suffering from a great range of physical and emotional illnesses. Often the first thing that a person needs is a listening ear and an understanding heart. Such a listener will be able to offer someone space in which to find new strength and the way forward to finding healing and reconciliation. But a good listener is hard to find.” Check out their website for their course offerings.

### Disciplemaking/Mentorship Culture

We have seen the powerful transformative journey that can happen from mentorship. While we prefer the term disciplemaking, we see mentorship as a great relationship structure to engage with anyone regardless of faith or any other demographic. Our aim is that each student and staff has at least one mentor who they meet with as much as once a week or at a minimum once a month.

We partner with LifeXchange in their mentoring courses.  From their website: “Being completely evidence-based in its approach, LifeXchange knows how long, how frequent and how intense mentoring should be in order for it to cause sustainable impact. They also know who to train, how to support and how to ensure the roll-out for an effective and responsible mentoring process.

With experience in community development, education, agriculture, health, faith ministries and youth development sectors, LifeXchange is what you should think when you think mentoring!”

Our staff where possible, go through the mentorship training course available online.
