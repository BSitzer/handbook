# Risks

We have a page which documents our biggest risks \(link\). Many of our values help to mitigate some of these risks.

**Introduction**

We frequently get asked questions like:

* What are the biggest risks to the organisation?
* What are your top concerns?
* What are your biggest fears?
* What keeps you up at night?

On this page, we document the biggest risks and how we intend to mitigate them. We also have a biggest tailwinds page to see what waves we are riding in our current market.

1. **Safety in and around the learning hub.** We operate in a space that has a high rate of crime. We take all measures to be safe but it is never guaranteed. 
2. **Ineffective recruitment strategies.** We hire based on values, locality to the learning hub and overall teachability. We do not hire purely on ability, intelligence and reputation.
