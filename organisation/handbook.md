# Handbook

### Handbook process

The handbook is meant to be a living document that can be changed by anyone at any time. 

Once a month, the designated leader of the handbook \(appointed every 6 months\), will review all changes as tracked in the change log. All changes should be communicated to all team members immediately when the change is made. If this was not the case then the handbook leader needs to coach/remind the changer to do so. If the person not communicating does it a second time then they will have a cool-off period of one week for not having access to change the handbook. Every subsequent non-communication results in an additional 1 week added to the cool-off period. In addition, the responsible person for non-communication should be engaged with as to the root cause of their non-communication.

The handbook is the Single source of truth \(SSOT\) for operations at Grace Cafe. Therefore, it needs to continuously evolve as operations evolve at Grace Cafe. Managers in particular are meant to champion the SSOT idea and create fun way for students to engage with the handbook.

A deep dive revision of the handbook will be done every 12 months where a full day \(two if need be\) is set aside where nothing else except handbook revision is done. This will be led by the appointed leader of the handbook \(elected every 6 months\) but everyone must participate where possible. 

### Elections

Elections of the leader of the handbook happen via the sociocracy general circle \(with everyone present\) every 3 months. Every subsequent election is set in the current election.

### Handbook Roadmap

The Handbook is currently in second draft and going out for second comment \(20 July 2021\).

As it is viewed as the Single Source of Truth \(SSOT\) for Grace Cafe operations and governance, it will grow as time goes on. It will also shrink as items that are not necessary will be taken out. The 12 monthly 1-2 day reviews will also be opportunities to ensure that the SSOT is kept focused. The whole team needs to really take ownership of keeping the handbook up to date. For this reason, part of the onboarding process will be updating the handbook. This will be through us maintaining a list of the current team members. Every new team member will add their name to the handbook. Team members leaving the team can either remove their name or the leader can remove it for them.
