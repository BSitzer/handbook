# Student legal registration

All students under the age of 15 should ideally be registered with the [Pestalozzi Trust](https://pestalozzi.org/en/home/). The annual cost is R400 per learner per year. This will protect them from any legal issues that might be attempted from any parties querying why the students are not in a public or private school.
